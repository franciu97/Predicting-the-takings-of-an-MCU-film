The "MCU Complete Dataset" contains information about films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), such as budget, box office, runtime, release date, viewer rating and critics rating (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayureshkoli/mcu-worldwide-box-office-collection).
The machine learning models that have been compared are Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision tree and Random Forest.
The results were plotted graphically with histplot and scatterplot
